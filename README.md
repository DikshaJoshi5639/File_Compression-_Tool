# 📦 Huffman File Compression Tool (C++)

This project implements a **File Compression and Decompression** system using the Huffman Encoding Algorithm. It’s designed to compress text files into smaller binary files and restore them with no loss of information. Ideal for learning data compression, file handling, and bit-level manipulation in C++.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 Compress any `.txt` file into a `.huff` binary file
- 🔹 Implements Huffman Tree using a priority queue (min-heap)
- 🔹 Bit-level file operations using `std::bitset`
- 🔹 Clean, modular C++ with headers and source separation

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Huffman Encoding (Lossless Compression)
- Priority Queues & Trees
- File I/O (Text + Binary)
- Bit Manipulation
- Object-Oriented Programming in C++
